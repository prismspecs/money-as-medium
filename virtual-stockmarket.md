# Virtual Stockmarket

+ Due Monday, bring in 3-5 cryptocurrencies that you would like to "invest" in.
+ You each start with $100, and you must invest at least $10 in each coin you choose.
+ We will determine on Monday at the start of class what the **exact** values are, which is important because of the high market volatility
+ Over the course of the next ten weeks, you may execute trades with classmates so long as they are well-documented, which must include exact exchange values and the time and date.
+ We will use [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) for the valuations. It's important that everyone uses the same source, as each can differ slightly.
+ Upload an image or some text to Slack each week that shows your holdings and value in USD.
+ On Monday you'll also need to provide some justification for your coin selection.

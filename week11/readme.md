### week 11 (11/4 & 11/6)

+ Present Parasite Projects

#### Presentation Format

Due to the wide range of projects being presented, the presentation format is not set in stone. For some people this will look like a standard presentation, including a slideshow and speaking about the project, followed by a Q&A. For others this might look more like an art crit, in which fellow students observe the art and give their impressions, followed by bring the artist into the conversation for a Q&A. For others, the presentation itself may be a kind of performance piece.

That said, some general guidelines (from which you can diverge):
  + A slide show including photo documentation. I encourage you to include as many visuals as you can (while remaining interesting and relevant to the project).
  + A 3-5 minute presentation on your project. In developing your presentation, ask yourself: Why did you do what you did? What was your intention? What was the outcome? How did people react? What did it feel like to create it?
  + Bring in physical elements of the project if you can. Save a bill, instead of putting everything into circulation.
  + Perhaps solicit some participation from your peers in real time. Can they help answer your central question through participation? Can they engage in some social media that engages with your project?
  + Allow for 2-5 minutes of Q&A. Be ready to address criticism *without being defensive*.
